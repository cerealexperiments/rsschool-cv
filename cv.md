### **About me:**

Currently I am a second year computer science student focused on learning web development.

I started teaching myself programming when I was 16, but at that time I didn't have a solid roadmap and because of that I was frustrated and gave up on learning. One year later I graduated from high school and on the summer holidays I started taking coding seriously. Since then, I've been constantly improving, teaching myself web development (mostly frontend).

### **Tech skills:**

- HTML, CSS/SCSS, TailwindCSS
- Javascript, TypeScript, Python
- React, RTK, Node
- Git, Postgresql

### **Work experience:**

I do not have any experience working on production, but during the course of my learning I've built some pet projects:

- Python game built with using the Pygame library: <https://github.com/cerealexperiments/the-swamp-incident>

- Basic react app displaying countries data:
  <https://github.com/cerealexperiments/countries>

### **Code example:**

Two Sum problem from leetcode:

```python
def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        answer = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if (nums[i] + nums[j]) == target:
                    answer.append(i)
                    answer.append(j)
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
        return answer
```
